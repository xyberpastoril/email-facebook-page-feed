# Email Facebook Page Feed

This is an experimental web project that parses a Facebook Page Feed using HtmlDomParser then sends the contents to your email. No Facebook Account required. Implemented in Laravel 9. **This is still a work in progress.**

**Note:** _This project does not work to pages using the New Pages' Experience. This is because the feed wouldn't be visible to the public and is treated like a public user account._
